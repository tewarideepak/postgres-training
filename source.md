## What is a Database?

An organized collection of data.
A method to manipulate and access the data.


## Database vs DBMS

Think of a database as a bookshelf full of books (data).
A DBMS is like a librarian who helps you organize, find, update, or remove books easily.

So, while a database is just a collection of stored information, a DBMS makes it efficient, secure, and accessible.


## What is RDBMS?

A type of database system that stores data in structured tables (using rows and columns) and uses SQL for managing and querying data.


## SQL

Structured Query Language
Which is used to talk to our databases.

Example: SELECT * FROM person_db;


## Switching Over to the postgres Account

Switch over to the postgres account on your server by typing:

    sudo -i -u postgres

You can now access the PostgreSQL prompt immediately by typing:

    psql

From there you are free to interact with the database management system as necessary.

Exit out of the PostgreSQL prompt by typing:

    \q


List down the database:

    \l


Change password:

    \password postgres


## Creating a new role

Currently, you just have the postgres role configured within the database. You can create new roles from the command line with the createrole command. The --interactive flag will prompt you for the name of the new role and also ask whether it should have superuser permissions.

If you are logged in as the postgres account, you can create a new user by typing:

    createuser --interactive

If, instead, you prefer to use sudo for each command without switching from your normal account, type:

    sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive

The script will prompt you with some choices and, based on your responses, execute the correct Postgres commands to create a user to your specifications.

You can get more control by passing some additional flags. Check out the options by looking at the man page:

    man createuser



# Creating a new database

CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;

Another assumption that the Postgres authentication system makes by default is that for any role used to log in, that role will have a database with the same name which it can access.

This means that if the user you created in the last section is called sammy, that role will attempt to connect to a database which is also called ‚Äúsammy‚Äù by default. You can create the appropriate database with the createdb command.

If you are logged in as the postgres account, you would type something like:

    createdb sammy

If, instead, you prefer to use sudo for each command without switching from your normal account, you would type:

    sudo -u postgres createdb sammy

This flexibility provides multiple paths for creating databases as needed.


## Database vs Schema vs Table

Imagine a library system:
üìö Database ‚Üí The entire library (all books, sections, and records).
üìÇ Schema ‚Üí A specific section (e.g., Fiction or Science) that organizes related books.
üìÑ Table ‚Üí A shelf in that section containing books on a particular topic.

So, a Database holds everything, a Schema organizes data logically, and a Table stores actual records in rows and columns.


## List down existing database

SELECT datname FROM pg_database;

\l


## Change a Database

\c <database_name>;


## Deleting a Database

DROP DATABASE <db_name>;


## CRUD

## Creating Tables

# Table

A table is a collection of related data held in a table format within a database.


CREATE TABLE person (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(100)
);


# List the table schema

\d person;


## Adding data into a table

INSERT INTO person(id, name, city)
VALUES (101, 'Raju', 'Delhi');

INSERT INTO students VALUES (101, 'RAHUL');

# Adding multiple data

INSERT INTO person(id, name, city)
VALUES
(101, 'Raju', 'Delhi'),
(102, 'Shyam', 'Mumbai');


## Reading data from a table

SELECT * FROM <table_name>;

SELECT <column_name> FROM students;
SELECT <column_name1, column_name2> FROM students;


## Updating the data

UPDATE person
    SET city='London'
    WHERE id=2;


## Deleting data from table

DELETE FROM students
    WHERE name='Raju';


## DataTypes

An attribute that specifies the type of data in a column of our database - table.

# Most widely used are

- Numeric - INT DOUBLE FLOAT DECIMAL
- String - VARCHAR
- Date - DATE
- Boolean - BOOLEAN


DECIMAL(5, 2)

5 - Total digit
2 - Digits after decimal

Example: 155.38, 28.15


## Constraint

A Constraint in PostgreSQL is a rule applied to a column.


# Primary Key

- The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.

- Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

- A table can have only ONE primary key.


# NOT NULL

CREATE TABLE customers
(
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);


# DEFAULT Value

CREATE TABLE customers
(
    acc_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    acc_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Savings'
);


# AUTO_INCREMENT

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    firstname VARCHAR(50),
    lastname VARCHAR(50)
);


## Task: Creating New Table

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    dept VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 30000.00,
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);


SELECT setval('employees_emp_id_seq', 1);

SELECT currval('employees_emp_id_seq');


## Data Refining

## RELATIONSHIP

# one to one

Each record in Table A is related to only one record in Table B, and vice versa.

Example:

A Users table and a UserProfiles table where each user has only one profile.

CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE UserProfiles (
    profile_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT UNIQUE,  -- Ensures one-to-one relationship
    bio TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

# one to many

Each record in Table A can be related to multiple records in Table B, but each record in Table B is related to only one record in Table A.
Example:

A Customers table and an Orders table where each customer can place multiple orders.

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

# many to many

A Students table and a Courses table where each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- Junction Table (Enrollment)
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Courses(course_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

## Foreign Key

A foreign key is a column (or a set of columns) in a database table that establishes a relationship between two tables. It refers to the primary key in another table, ensuring data integrity by enforcing referential constraints.

Key Points:

- Ensures Referential Integrity: Prevents actions that would break the relationship between tables (e.g., deleting a referenced record).
- Establishes Relationships: Links tables together in one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.
- Prevents Invalid Data: A foreign key can only contain values that exist in the referenced primary key column.

# Customers:

CREATE TABLE customers(
    cust_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO customers(cust_name)
VALUES
('Raju'),('Shyam'),('Paul'),('Alex');

# Orders:

CREATE TABLE orders(
    ord_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ord_date DATE NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    cust_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES
    customers(cust_id)
);

INSERT INTO orders (ord_date, cust_id, price)
VALUES
('2024-01-01', 1, 250.00),
('2024-01-15', 1, 300.00),
('2024-02-01', 2, 150.00),
('2024-03-01', 3, 450.00),
('2024-04-04', 2, 550.00);


## JOINS

JOIN operation is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

# Types of Join

# Cross Join

Every row from one table is combined with every row from another table.

SELECT * FROM customers CROSS JOIN orders;


# Inner Join

Returns only the rows where there is a match between the specified columns in both the left (or first) and right (or second) tables.

SELECT * FROM Customers AS c
INNER JOIN
orders AS o
ON c.cust_id = o.cust_id;

SELECT c.cust_name, COUNT(o.ord_id)
FROM customers as c
INNER JOIN orders as o
ON o.cust_id = c.cust_id
GROUP BY c.cust_name;


# Left Join

Returns all rows from the left (or first) table and the matching rows from the right (or second) table.

SELECT * FROM Customers AS c
LEFT JOIN
orders AS o
ON c.cust_id = o.cust_id;


# Right Join

Returns all rows from the right (or second) table and the matching rows from the left (or first) table.

SELECT * FROM Customers AS c
RIGHT JOIN
orders AS o
ON c.cust_id = o.cust_id;
